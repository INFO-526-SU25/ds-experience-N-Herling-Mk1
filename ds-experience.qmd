<!-- Let's have some fun and do some data science visualizing 
.
create a 'TV static box' (shout out to cosmic background radiation)
overlay it with a sine wave that represents signal/noise.
Sine wave transitions from sig->noise in animation.
[play/pause is provided]

## Part 2: Summarize your experience {#part-2-summarize-your-experience}

<div class="nice-text-box">
<b>Summary:</b><br> 
The book is a treatise on decision making, specifically forecasting of events. The path taken by the author uses failures such as the economic crisis of 2008, and successes such as hitting a baseball to frame decision making algorithmicaly.<br>
Beginning with the dictate that people are generally too overconfident in their own prognostiction, but predictive models by themselves aren't enough to guarantee success. The author eventually iterates towards the idea that Bayesian probabilistic models are the best tactic when determining predictions with complex or divergent phenomena.

Ultimately, The Signal and the Noise reminds us that good forecasting is not about certainty, but about disciplined humilityâ€”acknowledging what we don't know and being willing to revise our views as new data emerges. By advocating for Bayesian thinking, Silver offers a framework that values adaptability over bravado, and learning over guessing. In a world overwhelmed by noise, this mindset is both practical and necessary.<br>
<b>Something new?:</b>
This book was sort of a 'Malcolm Gladwell' cross-culture synthesis and synopsis of model usage, user error, user intelligence, and model limitation. So, the overall synthesis was new and exciting.<br>
<b>Connect to class:</b>
The idea of data presentation not being in concert with deductions being made from the data was covered in the book - as it has been coverred in the class.
